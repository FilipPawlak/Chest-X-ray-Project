1. Abstract</br>
The goal of the project is to build model to predict weather the lungs are healthy or not. I decided to use transfer learning from popular models trained on big datasets and choose the one, which is best in classification chest x-rays. The x-rays are in gray scale, therefore I duplicated data to three layers to make it possible to use models trained on RGB images.
